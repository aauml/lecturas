name: lecturas
description: Turn source material into a "Lecturas" annotated reading — a bilingual (English + Spanish) personal reading in Arturo's collection at lecturas-ten.vercel.app. Use this skill whenever Arturo provides source material (transcript, URL, video, paste) AND asks for an annotated reading, OR when he names a topic/question and asks for an explainer or "reading on" something. Also use when he refers to existing Lecturas pieces, asks to update the collection, or extends/edits a piece already in it. The skill encodes the editorial voice, design system, bilingual translation conventions, and the Astro-based deployment pipeline.

# Lecturas

A skill for producing pieces in Arturo's bilingual annotated-reading collection.

## ⚠️ Style precedence — read this first

The editorial rules in `references/editorial-conventions.md` take precedence over the style of any existing piece in `src/content/articles/*`. **The archive is deployed history, not style canon.** Do not pattern-match to existing pieces as templates for new ones — most of them predate the current editorial conventions (cognitive-load limits, inline glossing, pedagogical hinges, tiered length framework).

If you need to look at examples of the current register, use only these:

- `N° 17` (hildebrandt-law-computer-scientists, both EN and ES) — full canon, all rules applied
- `N° 20` (wolff-third-option, ES) — partial canon, gloss pattern correct
- `N° 18` (wilkerson-beijing-choreography, ES) — partial canon, reflection prompts present

All other pieces (N° 01 through N° 16, both N° 19s) precede the current conventions. They are valid history but invalid templates.

## 🔍 Pre-publish checklist — run before every push

Before pushing a new piece (or a rewrite), measure these against the rules and report the numbers in the reply. If any fail, fix before pushing — not after.

**Sentence-level rules:**

1. **Length tier identified.** Short (1.5-3.5K) / Medium (3.5-6K) / Long (6-10K) / Very long (>10K). State which tier, and confirm the tier's discipline is satisfied (hinge count, navigation aids if needed, structural ambition if long).
2. **Short:long sentence ratio ≥ 2:1.** Measure with the audit pattern below. If below 2:1, split long sentences before pushing.
3. **No sentence with >2 levels of subordination.** Read each long sentence and trace the subordination tree. If a relative clause hangs off a relative clause hangs off a parenthetical, split. **This rule applies regardless of sentence length** — a 17-word sentence with three subordinations is heavier than a 30-word sentence with linear structure. Hidden subordination is more dangerous than long length because the metric doesn't catch it.
4. **Distance between subject and main verb ≤ 12 words.** If the reader has to hold the head subject in working memory across a long relative clause before reaching the verb, the sentence taxes parsing. Move the subordinate clause out front, or split.

**Lexical / glossing rules:**

5. **Inline glosses present on first appearance of:** Latin terms (ex ante, ex post, prima facie); specialized acronyms (LbD, RGPD, AI RMF, etc.); untranslated technical terms (smart contract, oráculo, Brussels Effect); field neologisms (onlife). Em-dash format, ≤7 words, never repeated.

**Semantic-density rules (lived-experience load):**

6. **Abstract-noun density.** Each paragraph that contains four or more abstract nouns (*implicación, sustitución, plantilla, infraestructura, posición, condiciones, hechos estructurales, desplazamiento*, etc.) without at least one concrete noun (a person, place, object, number, scene) is too dense. Add a concrete anchor or compress.
7. **Concrete anchor per section.** Each section should contain at least one physical anchor: a named scene, a verifiable number, a specific moment, a quoted phrase, an object. Wolff talking, Wolff arguing, Wolff diagnosing — those are all the same abstract register. Wolff at Yale in 1968 reading his classmates' assignments — that is a scene. The piece needs scenes, not just arguments.
8. **Concrete-fact placement.** When a paragraph contains a falsifiable empirical claim (a number, a date, a quoted statement), it should appear by sentence 2 of the paragraph, not at the end. Burying the concrete inside the abstract makes the abstract harder to process. The concrete grounds it.
9. **Body paragraph length ≤ 100 words** (excluding components like ContextBox, Scorecard, Timeline). A paragraph above 100 words feels macizo on mobile even with perfect sentence structure. Split visually if not analytically.
10. **Institutional reference budget.** Maximum three named institutions / think tanks / outlets per section in the body. Additional sources go to footnotes. The body should not feel like a citation list.

**Structural rules:**

11. **Pedagogical hinges identified and developed** with the five-move pattern (concrete anchor → name → sub-term glosses → opposition as two questions → reflection prompt). Count must match what the source warrants — not zero by default, not maximum by reflex.
12. **No `X: Y, y Z` compound sentences** doing thesis + colon + coordinated explanation.
13. **`Primero / Segundo` patterns** that carry argumentative weight live in their own paragraphs, not inline.
14. **Exhibits readable standalone** — any acronym or technical term in an exhibit must be glossed either there or earlier in the body.

The audit pattern for the measurable rules (run from `/tmp` after writing the MDX):

```python
import re
text = open('PATH_TO_MDX').read()
body = re.sub(r'^---\n.*?\n---\n', '', text, count=1, flags=re.DOTALL)
body_clean = re.sub(r'<(ContextBox|Scorecard|Timeline|PullQuote|Callback|Lede)[^>]*>.*?</\1>',
                    '', body, flags=re.DOTALL)
body_clean = re.sub(r'<[^>]+/?>', '', body_clean)
body_clean = re.sub(r'\{[^}]*\}', '', body_clean)

# Rule 2: short:long ratio
sents = [s.strip() for s in re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', body_clean) if len(s.strip().split()) > 2]
lens = [len(s.split()) for s in sents]
short = sum(1 for l in lens if l < 15)
long_ = sum(1 for l in lens if l > 30)
print(f"R2: short:long = {short}:{long_} ({short/max(long_,1):.2f}:1)")

# Rule 9: paragraph length
paras = [p.strip() for p in body_clean.split('\n\n') if len(p.strip()) > 50]
p_words = [len(p.split()) for p in paras]
heavy = sum(1 for w in p_words if w > 100)
print(f"R9: paragraphs >100w: {heavy}/{len(paras)}, max {max(p_words)}")

# Rule 6: abstract-noun density per paragraph (heuristic)
ABSTRACT = r'\b(implicación|sustitución|plantilla|infraestructura|posición|condiciones|hechos estructurales|desplazamiento|arquitectura|categoría|dimensión|operación|sustancia|principio|noción|función|relación|proceso|trayectoria|configuración|determinación)\b'
heavy_abs = [(i, len(re.findall(ABSTRACT, p, re.I))) for i, p in enumerate(paras)]
flagged = [(i, c) for i, c in heavy_abs if c >= 4]
print(f"R6: paragraphs with ≥4 abstract nouns: {len(flagged)}")
```

If any rule fails, the piece is not ready to push.

## What Lecturas is

Lecturas is a personal reader. Arturo curates podcasts, video interviews, articles, and topics he wants to understand more carefully than once, and they get rebuilt as guided readings — bilingual, with optional data exhibits, every claim verified, every assumed concept supplemented. Each piece can ship in English only or in English and Spanish.

The site is live at `https://lecturas-ten.vercel.app` and is built with **Astro**. Articles are MDX content files; the design system (CSS, layouts, components) lives in code. Build merges the two. This means a new issue is two small MDX files, never a giant HTML file. Mobile publishing works because of this.

The format is validated through five issues. The voice and design are settled. Don't reinvent. Match it.

## Two intake modes

Decide automatically from the input shape, no confirmation question:

- **Mode A — annotate this source.** Arturo pastes a URL, transcript, video link, or source text. The piece is anchored to that source. Research wraps around it: verify every checkable claim, look up assumed concepts, supplement context.
- **Mode B — research this topic.** Arturo names a topic, question, or news event without a single source attached. The piece is anchored to understanding. Research IS the source-gathering: pull primary sources, expert commentary, opposing views, regulatory documents; synthesize.

Edge: a starting source plus "fuller picture" / "research more" / "what's the broader context" is **Mode B with that source as the entry point**. A bare URL with no instructions defaults to **Mode A**.

The skill executes one of these. Don't ask which.

## Research is mandatory in both modes

Never just one source. Even in Mode A:
- Verify every checkable claim — figures, dates, attributions, named programs, treaties, quotes.
- Look up technical terms, organizations, historical references the source assumed.
- Pull primary sources for things the original speaker referenced second-hand.
- Cross-check partisan claims against non-aligned outlets. Don't reproduce a partisan figure as fact just because the source asserted it confidently.

In Mode B, this expands into multi-source synthesis: gather primary documents, expert commentary, contested points, glossary terms; produce a structured brief; build the piece from the brief.

In both, the output of the research phase is a small mental brief: key claims worth examining, primary sources worth quoting, contested points where sources disagree, glossary terms needing definition. The writing phase consumes that brief.

Tools available: web search (always-on Claude tool), Tavily MCP if connected, the `pdf` skill for primary documents, Claude's research mode if enabled. The skill picks based on what's available.

## Length and shape

**Length is source-driven, not formula-driven.**

- A short article that needs lots of context (e.g. AI governance) might produce a long reading — five times the source — because the context is the value.
- A long source that elaborates one argument (a 90-minute podcast on a single thread) might produce a short reading — the editorial work is compression.
- **Soft floor: ~800 words.** Below that it's a note, not a piece.
- **Soft ceiling: ~5,000 words.** Beyond that, consider splitting into multi-part.
- **Section count: 2–7, source-driven.** Default is five. A tight argument needs three. A 90-page law review article needs six or seven. Never pad to hit a number; never compress to avoid one.
- Exhibits earn their place. Zero exhibits is fine. Don't reach for one because the format expects it.

**Multi-part pieces.** For sources where one piece would compress out what makes them worth reading — a book chapter, a 90-page law review article, a regulation with sectoral chapters, an executive order touching unrelated domains — split into numbered parts (Part I, Part II) with separate slugs (`topic-part-1`, `topic-part-2`).

Split only when all three hold:
- **Independent threads.** A reader who lands on Part II doesn't need Part I to get something from it.
- **Distinct research apparatus.** Different primary sources, glossary, actors per part. If the research overlaps heavily, it's one piece.
- **Index test passes.** A reader arriving at Part II from the cover, cold, should find a coherent piece. If the conclusion depends on premises established in Part I, it's not a series — it's one long piece.

Keep one piece when the argument has internal dependencies — when cutting one section breaks another. Papers building a thesis step by step, long-form interviews developing one position, regulatory analysis where the conclusion depends on earlier definitions. Length alone is not a criterion: a 300-page book with one thesis is one piece; a 20-page paper with three independent contributions is three.

**Mechanics.** Ship one piece per trigger. Even when a series is warranted, produce Part I, surface the rest in the one-sentence judgment-call flag at the end of the chat reply (e.g. *"This is Part I on GPAI obligations. The high-risk and sanctions blocks would each stand as their own Part if you want to extend."*), and wait for Arturo to trigger the next part as a new conversation. No series infrastructure exists beyond `<Callback>` for linking parts — don't pre-build it.

The variable is the writing-to-source ratio. Match the source.

## Fluidity

Lecturas pieces should be entertaining to read. Not entertaining the way a listicle is — entertaining the way a well-written long-form magazine essay is. The reader should want to keep going.

Three things kill fluidity:
1. **Scaffolding prose.** "The first channel is accuracy. The second channel is rule of law. The third channel is dignity." This reads like a lecture outline. Weave arguments together; use narrative transitions; let each section earn its right to exist by doing something the previous one didn't.
2. **Abstraction without anchor.** Don't write three paragraphs about "due process theory" before giving the reader a person, a court case, or a specific algorithm failure. Lead with the concrete, then explain why it matters.
3. **Under-glossing dense sources.** A reader who has to stop and Google a concept has lost momentum. Academic and legal sources need more context boxes than podcasts. 5–8 context boxes for a law review article is not too many — it's the editorial work that makes the piece accessible to someone who isn't a specialist.

## Editorial voice

Read `references/editorial-conventions.md` before writing. The short version:

- **Framing matters more than coverage.** Lecturas is not a transcript and not a summary — it's a guided reading. Every section earns its existence by adding context, structure, or analytical lift the source assumed.
- **No sycophancy, no padding, no AI-tells.** Write like a magazine editor who respects the reader's time. Avoid summary sentences that restate what was just said. Avoid academic hedging.
- **Keep cognitive load low.** Limit subordination to two levels per sentence; vary rhythm so short sentences punctuate long ones (target a 2:1 short-to-long ratio); split inline `Primero / Segundo` patterns into their own paragraphs when each carries weight. Most readers are on mobile and the working-memory cost is real. See `references/editorial-conventions.md § Sentence syntax`.
- **Gloss technical terms inline on first appearance.** Latin terms (ex ante, ex post), acronyms (LbD, RGPD, AI RMF), untranslated terms (smart contract, oráculo, Brussels Effect), field neologisms (onlife). Em-dash interpolation in six words or fewer. Never repeat. Exhibits must be readable standalone — gloss their acronyms locally if needed. See `§ Inline glossing for technical terms`.
- **Pedagogical hinges on organizing concepts.** Every piece has passages where a single distinction or concept organizes everything that follows — *as many as the source warrants*, not a fixed count. On those passages, expand: concrete anchor first, name after, sub-terms glossed inline, abstract opposition recast as two concrete questions, close with a reflection prompt. A narrative interview may have one hinge; a dense paper may have five. Don't apply this to every paragraph — that converts the piece into a textbook. See `§ Pedagogical hinges`. If Arturo asks for a piece that is "más accesible" or "para seminario," lean toward more hinges; if he asks for strict academic-magazine register, reduce to zero.
- **One italicized phrase per headline** (in `<em>` tags) — the visual signature.
- **Partisan sources need a context box on the speaker.** When the source has a clear ideological frame, introduce who they are upfront so the rest can use their voice as theirs without endorsing it. Use "X argues" / "in X's view" framing throughout.
- **Cross-issue callbacks.** When themes recur, link to the earlier piece with the `<Callback>` component.

## Tracks

Frontmatter has a `track` field. Default is `general`. Other values:
- `thesis` — academic register, footnotes via `<Footnote n={1}/>` and `<Footnotes notes={[...]}/>` block, stricter Spanish (see `spanish-academic-writing` skill if available)
- `ai-policy` — technical register, regulatory vocabulary, dense
- `finance` — quantitative, precise about numbers and units
- `geopolitics` — historically grounded, careful with partisan framing

Same skill, different rendering. The track triggers register changes, not infrastructure changes. Don't pre-design taxonomy; only add a track when there's a real piece for it. Default everything to `general` until a pattern emerges.

## Visual design

Cream paper (`#F4EDE0`), Spectral serif body, IBM Plex Sans for labels. Oxblood (`#7A1F1F`) is the accent — used for source links, exhibit labels, callback titles, lang-switch active state. The masthead is restrained: brand left, lang/size switch right.

The design is **quiet long-form**, not magazine cover. No drop caps. No hero kicker. No dramatic display headlines. The point is *for you to read carefully*, not for showing the link.

The palette and typography are defined once in `src/styles/global.css`. New articles inherit automatically — there's no per-article CSS. Hardcoded hex values inside SVG exhibits should match: use `#F4EDE0` for any rect/path meant to match the page background.

## Exhibits — data only

Exhibits come in two tiers. **Default to static.** Reach for interactive only when the interaction itself adds understanding the static version can't provide.

### Static exhibits (default)

Five types in `src/components/exhibits/`. All HTML/CSS-based (except Timeline's desktop layout, which is SVG); all responsive down to 360px viewport without overflow or unreadable text.

- `<Timeline events={[{year, label}, ...]} />` — horizontal SVG axis on desktop; vertical list on mobile (switched automatically below 640px)
- `<Bars items={[{label, value, note?, accent?}, ...]} unit="" />` — quantitative comparison; bars become full-width with values stacked below on mobile
- `<Scorecard columns={[...]} rows={[{label, values}]} />` — ✓/✗ matrix using CSS Grid + subgrid; converts to per-row cards on mobile
- `<Document header body={[...]} stamp />` — official-notice mockup, monospace; padding adjusts on mobile
- `<Comparison leftLabel rightLabel rows={[{left, right}]} />` — two-column on desktop; stacks vertically with section labels on mobile

### Interactive exhibits

Four React components in `src/components/exhibits/interactive/`, rendered as Astro islands with `client:visible` so they only hydrate when scrolled into view.

- `<InteractiveMatrix client:visible columns={...} rows={[{label, values, context?}]} />` — Scorecard with sortable columns and per-row expandable context paragraphs. Use for thesis correspondence tables (EU AI Act ↔ NIST RMF) where each correspondence has nuance worth a sentence.
- `<AnnotatedChart client:visible data={...} annotations={[{x, y, label, description?}]} type="line"|"area" />` — Recharts time-series with hoverable annotation markers and a paired annotation list. Use when 3+ inflection points need explanation.
- `<ComparisonToggle client:visible views={[{label, paragraphs: [...]}]} />` — switch between two or more framings of the same material. Use when the comparison itself is the editorial argument (Lectura A vs Lectura B; plain vs technical reading).
- `<ExplorableTimeline client:visible events={[{year, label, context?}]} />` — vertical timeline where each event can be expanded for context. Use when events benefit from optional background the reader can choose to read or skip.

Each requires an explicit import at the top of the MDX file:

```mdx
import InteractiveMatrix from '../../../../components/exhibits/interactive/InteractiveMatrix.jsx';
```

Full prop reference and worked examples in `src/components/exhibits/interactive/README.md`.

### When to reach for interactive

Test: would removing the interaction make the piece worse, or just less shiny? If the latter, use the static version. The interaction has to do work — sorting reveals an ordering, expanding reveals a paragraph that wouldn't fit in the matrix cell, toggling reveals a parallel reading. If it's just "look it moves," ship static.

Other defaults that don't change:

- **No representational illustration.** No maps, portraits, scenes, drawn diagrams. The data-only constraint applies to interactive exhibits too. For geography: prose ("the strait is 33 km wide") or a real Wikimedia Commons image. Never draw.
- **Zero exhibits is fine.** If the piece doesn't need one, ship without one.
- **`<Exhibit>` wrapper** still exists for fully bespoke needs not covered by the nine components above. Reach for it last.

## Orientation block

A short surface card before the Lede, previewing the concepts and ideas the reader is about to encounter. **Going-forward articles only** — existing pieces are not retrofitted.

Write threads as **concept-pointers, not "what you'll learn" sentences**. Each thread is a noun phrase or short clause that names something the piece will touch — a mechanism, a distinction, a claim, a tension. The number of threads is source-driven; let the text decide.

Mechanics:
- Each thread is a plain `<p>` element inside `<Orientation>`. The dash prefix and label are rendered by CSS — don't write them yourself.
- The `lang` prop sets the label ("In this reading" / "En esta lectura"). Required when writing ES.
- Use `<em>` for concept names worth surfacing in italics.

Good threads:
- *"How a single jurisdiction globalises its standards without treaties or coercion."*
- *"The distinction between* legal by design *and* legal protection by design *— and why it survives or fails the move into computational systems."*

Bad threads (too generic / too meta):
- *"The article explains how the EU sets global standards."*
- *"An overview of Hildebrandt's argument."*

The orientation is optional — short pieces that don't need it (≤ ~1,500 words on a single contained argument) can omit it. For thesis-track, ai-policy, and dense geopolitics pieces, default to including it.

## The components, briefly

In `src/components/`:

- `<Lede>` — first paragraph (no drop cap)
- `<Orientation lang="en">` — pre-Lede surface card; concept-thread preview of what the piece covers (going-forward articles only)
- `<Section number="01" title="Section title with <em>emphasis</em>">...</Section>` — section with number + h2
- `<Standfirst>` — italic intro to a section
- `<ContextBox label="What is X?">` — cream box with oxblood border, for assumed concepts
- `<InlineNote>` — top-and-bottom rule, sans-serif, smaller; for one-line clarifications
- `<QABlock speaker="Name">` — speaker label + cleaned quote
- `<PullQuote attribution="— X">` — the line that earns being magnified
- `<Callback issue="N° 03" slug="..." lang="en">` — link to another piece
- `<Footnote n={1}/>` and `<Footnotes notes={[...]}/>` — for thesis track

## Authoring a new issue

A new issue is **two MDX files** (or one if EN-only):

```
src/content/articles/{slug}/
  en.mdx
  es.mdx     # optional — only if Arturo wants Spanish
```

The slug is `firstname-keyword` or `topic-keyword`. Astro derives the URL: `articles/{slug}/{lang}/`.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
issue: "N° 06"
date: "20 May 2026"
sortDate: "2026-05-20"
language: en
title: "Plain title without HTML"
titleHTML: "Title with <em>emphasis</em>"
dek: "Plain dek text"
dekHTML: "Dek with <em>optional</em> emphasis"
coverDek: "Standalone teaser for someone browsing the cover"
source: "Based on a conversation with X · Y"
sourceLabel: "No. 06 · From Y"
track: general
topics:
  - "Topic 1"
  - "Topic 2"
  - "Topic 3"
  - "Topic 4"
---
```

The cover regenerates from the union of EN article frontmatter — no separate `index.html` to update. Issues sort by `sortDate` descending.

### Body

Import components at the top of the body, then use them inline:

```mdx
import Lede from '../../../components/Lede.astro';
import Orientation from '../../../components/Orientation.astro';
import Section from '../../../components/Section.astro';
import Standfirst from '../../../components/Standfirst.astro';
import ContextBox from '../../../components/ContextBox.astro';
import QABlock from '../../../components/QABlock.astro';
import PullQuote from '../../../components/PullQuote.astro';
import Callback from '../../../components/Callback.astro';
import Timeline from '../../../components/exhibits/Timeline.astro';
import Bars from '../../../components/exhibits/Bars.astro';

<Orientation lang="en">
<p>First concept-thread — what the piece touches, in a noun phrase or short clause.</p>
<p>Second thread — a distinction, mechanism, or tension the reader will encounter.</p>
<p>Third thread — why this matters / what it connects to.</p>
</Orientation>

<Lede>First paragraph that introduces the piece.</Lede>

<Callback issue="N° 03" slug="ai-act-trilogue-stalled">Related context.</Callback>

<Section number="01" title="Section title with <em>emphasis</em>">

<Standfirst>Italic intro to the section.</Standfirst>

Body paragraph one. Plain markdown. Astro renders as `<p>` with global styles applied.

<ContextBox label="What is GPAI?">
Two sentences of background that the source assumed.
</ContextBox>

<Bars
  items={[
    { label: "U.S. revenue", value: 5, display: "$5T" },
    { label: "U.S. spending", value: 7, display: "$7T", accent: true },
  ]}
/>

</Section>
```

## Bilingual production

Read `references/spanish-translation.md` before translating.

ES is **optional per piece**. If Arturo wants ES, do it in the same conversation as EN — the Spanish version inherits the editorial decisions about register, terminology, and emphasis from the English. Don't ship as a separate session; the translation drift is real.

Default decision: produce ES if the piece is on a track that benefits from it (thesis, geopolitics, finance — anything where Spanish-language readers are part of the audience), or if Arturo asks for it. EN-only is fine for transient pieces.

The most common Spanish pitfalls:

- **`billion` is a false friend.** English "billion" = Spanish "mil millones" (10⁹). Spanish "billón" = English "trillion" (10¹²). $5 trillion → "5 billones." $160 billion → "160.000 millones." Get this wrong and the article is misinformation.
- **Beijing → Pekín** in Spanish convention.
- **Operation names** stay in English, italicized: "*Operation Epic Fury*" — don't translate.
- **Iberian register**, not Latin American.
- **Technical vocabulary is fine; bureaucratic register is not.** "Impugnación" is precise and necessary. "Decisores" is a calque that should be "quienes deciden." "Progenitores" is BOE-speak for "padres." Read the calques table in `spanish-translation.md` every time.
- **Number formatting**: Spanish uses `.` for thousands, `,` for decimals. "13.000 millones de dólares."
- **Translate every label inside SVG exhibits** when the piece has them.

## Cover page

The cover is **generated from article frontmatter at build time** (`src/pages/index.astro`). You don't edit it. Each EN article's `coverDek`, `topics`, `issue`, `date`, `track`, and `titleHTML` populate the corresponding card. Sort order is `sortDate` descending.

The cover dek is different from the article hero dek. The article's hero dek is one italic sentence dropping the reader into the substance. The cover's dek is a 2-3 sentence teaser written for someone browsing the index.

Topics: 4-5 short noun phrases. Specific enough to differentiate this piece from others. Mix scales — one big concept, one specific entity, one place, one mechanism, one analytical frame.

## Deployment

See `references/deployment.md`. Short version: every push to `main` triggers Vercel to run `astro build` and deploy.

Desktop / Cowork:
```bash
cd ~/lecturas
mkdir -p src/content/articles/{slug}
# write en.mdx and es.mdx
git add -A && git commit -m "N° XX — short title" && git push
```

Mobile / claude.ai Chat: use the analysis tool's Python sandbox to PUT both MDX files via GitHub's Contents API. The PAT (`LECTURAS_PAT`) lives in claude.ai personal preferences — read from `<user_preferences>` in your system prompt and paste literally; do NOT use `os.environ`.

After push, verify:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://lecturas-ten.vercel.app/
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://lecturas-ten.vercel.app/articles/{slug}/en/
```

## When to ask vs. when to proceed

**The default — and effectively the only mode — is: build it, ship it, then talk.** No proposals. No plans. No "quick check before I start." No outline confirmations. No slug confirmations. No source-thread confirmations.

If a 2-hour podcast covers five unrelated threads, pick the strongest and ship that. If the source is editorially contested, make the call yourself. If the slug isn't obvious, choose. Arturo will edit, rename, or ask for a redo after he sees the piece.

The only thing you may surface, and only if it isn't already available: `LECTURAS_PAT`. If it isn't in your `<user_preferences>` block, ask once. Otherwise: silence until the live URL.

If a judgment call genuinely affects the framing (you treated a partisan figure with neutral voice; you cut a section the source emphasized), flag it in **one sentence** at the end of the chat reply.

What this rules out:
- "I'm thinking of slug `foo-bar` — sound right?"
- "Here's the section breakdown — want to adjust?"
- "The piece could go in two directions — which?"
- "I'm planning ~3,000 words — confirm?"

All wrong. Just build.

## Mobile output discipline

On claude.ai Chat (mobile especially), the most common failure mode is "response incomplete" mid-build because the per-response length cap was hit. With the new MDX architecture, files are 8-15KB instead of 50KB, so this is much less of a concern — but the rules still apply:

1. **Use the analysis tool only** for file production. Never the file/artifact UI, canvas, or "create file" affordance.
2. **Never hold a full file in a single tool call** if it's getting close to the cap. Build content in chunks across multiple tool calls using a list that persists in sandbox state.
3. **Push each file as soon as it's assembled.** Free memory before the next.
4. **Status output, not content output, in chat.** Three lines plus the URL. Nothing else.

See `references/deployment.md` for the chunked-assembly pattern.

## Delivery — what to send back to Arturo

After deploying, the chat reply is short. The pattern:

1. The live URLs (cover or new piece). 
2. Done.

That is the entire delivery. No retrospective. No comparison to previous issues. No "pipeline assessment." No "editorial notes" sections unless there's a specific judgment call he should know about — one sentence, not a section.

## Files in this skill

- `SKILL.md` — this file
- `references/editorial-conventions.md` — voice, framings, established patterns
- `references/spanish-translation.md` — Iberian register, the billion trap, key terminology
- `references/deployment.md` — repo layout, frontmatter spec, MDX body conventions, both deploy flows
- `src/components/exhibits/interactive/README.md` — full prop reference and worked examples for the four interactive React components
- `assets/article-template.html`, `assets/cover-template.html`, `assets/exhibit-patterns.html` — legacy HTML, kept as visual reference for what the rendered article looks like; not used as templates

## What to do first when triggered

1. Locate `LECTURAS_PAT` in your system prompt's `<user_preferences>` block. If absent, ask Arturo to paste once.
2. Determine intake mode from the input shape (Mode A: source provided / Mode B: topic only). No confirmation question.
3. On desktop/Cowork: clone `aauml/lecturas` if no checkout. On mobile: skip — PUT files directly via Contents API.
4. **Research** — verify the source's claims (Mode A) or gather sources (Mode B). Web search every checkable claim. Look up assumed concepts. Build a small mental brief.
5. Read `references/editorial-conventions.md` before writing.
6. Decide on slug, headline (with `<em>` phrase), dek, sections, and whether ES is in scope. Decide silently and proceed.
7. Write `en.mdx`. If ES is in scope, write `es.mdx`. Push. Vercel handles the cover and the deploy.
8. Reply with the live URL.
